# Design Report

## Introduction  
This report contains the implementation of a simple TicTacToe game with a web application, for the late-term project in software engineering. We used the version control server Github from the very beginning of the project. All  business logic code is loosely coupled and used with Test Driven Development. We used Travis as an integration server and the web application is available through an app deployed on Heroku. 

## Operating environment and design environment
Here below is a list of tools that were used during the development of the project. Advania provided a QStack cloud which is a linux virtual machine that was used for programming the project. 

|**name**|**Usage**|
|--------|---------|
|QStack  | Integration Server|
|Gradle | Build tool|
|Travis | Continous Integration Server|
|Github| Version Control Server|
|Heroku|Staging/Production Env.|
|Junit| java tests|
|Selenium|end-to-end tests|
